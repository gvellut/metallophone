# Metallophone

Simple Lilypond scores for toy metallophones or xylophones (8 bars, 1 octave, C major scale), like the Animambo metallophone or Fisher-Price xylophone.

Sample PDF outputs are in folder sample-outputs.

## Usage

To use, print the score and color the numbered circles according to the color scheme of the instrument: The biggest bar is 1 and the smallest is 8, as shown below.

Then, when playing, simply follow the colors to know which bar to strike.
