# Metallophone

Simple Lilypond scores (partitions) for toy metallophones or xylophones (8 bars, 1 octave, C major scale), like Animambo metallophone or Fisher-Price xylophone.

Sample PDF outputs are in folder sample-outputs.

## Usage

To use, print the score and color the circles with numbers in them  according to the color scheme of the instrument (the biggest bar is 1, the smallest is 8).
